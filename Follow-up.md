Let's get started  
Web  APIs
There are a couple different types of web APIs in this modern web age. However, even though their more of operations differ, they still run on the HTTP protocol that servers/computers on the internet use to communicate

some of the commmon types of web APIs include 
REST API (Representational State Transfer ): it's probably the most common kind of web API that's used in modern web applications as of now. REST APIs utilize JSON objects as the means of transferring data

SOAP API(Simple Object Access Protocol): it's an old age form of Web APIs, A lot of Legacy software still make use  of this kind of web API (banking software systems for example ). These APIs use XML for transmitting information over HTTP

GRaphQL APIs: originally developped by Facebook (now Meta ) Engineers. Developed in an attempt to build a solution to the problem of having to make muliple calls to traditional REST APIs by building a resource query language for APIs . GraphQL also utilizes JSON for transmtting information, however it requires  use of queries to send requests to servers over HTTP as opposed to sending request individually

GRPC:Google's Remote Procedural Call): originally developed by Google and it's twist on Remote Procedural Call framework  it utilizes protobofs instead of JSONfor data transmission)
